MonsterSweetLove! is a game made in IsartDigital in 3days for a GameWeek.

I made all the code in this project. Yet you should't take care of the code quality.

The big part of the gameplay is in [Player](https://github.com/Lawlets/MonsterSweetLove/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Character/Player.cs). But you can still check [others characters](https://github.com/Lawlets/MonsterSweetLove/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/Character) code.

If you want to test the game, you can download the .rar file [here](https://www.fichier-rar.fr/2019/03/11/monstersweetlovev2/).
There is no translation available, but if you really want to understand, you can take your time to translate questions and answers.
